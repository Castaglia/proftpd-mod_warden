mod_warden

Deletes blacklisted files (and globs?) at various times during the session.
This can be used to mitigate attacks such as the "Roaring Beast" exploit
by removing files which should not ever be present/used by sessions.

How to enable the blacklist deletion only for chrooted sessions?
Maybe mod_warden should (initially) only be in effect for chrooted sessions.
What if the file can't be deleted by the user in question?  Delete the
blacklisted files post-chroot, but pre-RootRevoke?

Check for blacklisted files on:

  chroot
  login
  upload
  rename 

How will mod_warden interact with e.g. quotas?  Anonymous logins?

Make sure it works with SFTP/SCP connections as well.

If path is a symlink, delete the link (but not the target file).
